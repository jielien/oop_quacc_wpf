QUACC, aka QUick ACCes command line, is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that provides the user with a quick command line interface. Using the command line, users can open files, directories, URLs, create notes, reminders, and more.

# How to Use

To use QUACC, simply build and run the application. From there, you can start typing commands into the main Command Window. To minimize QUACC, press the *ESC* key. To bring it back up, use the key combination *Shift+Ctrl+P*. I'd like to make the application more customizable in the future.

# Latest Version

The latest version, __Armstrong__, is the first version that is somewhat usable.

## Features

- Creating shortcuts to files, directories or URLs
- Directly opening files, directories and URLs
- Quick Google search
- Basic commands history
- ...
- That's about it.

# What's to Come?

Right now is the app in version 0.0.1 Armstrong and is actually quite useful already. So the first item on my to-do list is to make QUACC more user-friendly by working on the user interface, creating a settings window, and potentially implementing color templates.
